1. What is website, and how is it different from web application?
-A website is a collection of web pages that provide and focus on giving  information to the user. Meanwhile a web application is a software program that is interactive with the user that focuses on giving services and performing specific tasks.

2. Why do you think organizations (like officers or schools) need websites?
-Having a website helps the organization to stay updated on what is happening, as well as share information about their organization through it, they can also use it to update their audience, they can facilitate interaction or engagement with their partnerships or stakeholders through it.

3. What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repository?
-The challenge that I have only encountered while creating my repository is unfamiliarity in the application, I have never used the application so I don't know yet what to do, what to click. I just watched a video on YouTube that helped me created my first repository.

4. How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?
-It can help the project to be well-documented, and maintained. It can also facilitate communication and collaboration among team members, and stockholders.
